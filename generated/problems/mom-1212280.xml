<statement>
<p>
Consider a lake whose center is located at <m>\displaystyle{\left({0},{0}\right)}</m>.  Let <m>\displaystyle{f{{\left({x},{y}\right)}}}</m> be a function that determines the amount of pollutant in a lake at point <m>\displaystyle{\left({x},{y}\right)}</m>, which is located  <m>\displaystyle{x}</m> meters east and <m>\displaystyle{y}</m> meters north of the center of the lake. </p>
<p>
Choose the best interpretation for <m>\displaystyle\nabla{f{{\left({0},{0}\right)}}}</m> concerning the center of the lake.</p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>It indicates the direction in which the pollution decreases the fastest.</li> 
<li>It indicates the direction in which pollution is constant.</li> 
<li>It indicates how polluted the lake is at the center.</li>
