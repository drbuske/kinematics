<statement>
<p>
Suppose you were standing on the <m>\displaystyle{x}{y}</m>-plane at the point <m>\displaystyle{\left({6},{4},{0}\right)}</m>, with the positive <m>\displaystyle{z}</m>-axis directed straight upward, and you were facing the <m>\displaystyle{y}{z}</m>-plane.</p>
<p>
If you walked forward 5 units, turned <m>\displaystyle{180}</m> degrees to the right, walked forward 2 units, and then finally rose straight upward by 3 units, what would be your final position?</p>
<p>
Give your answer as a point: (<underscore/><underscore/>, <underscore/><underscore/>, <underscore/><underscore/>)</p>
