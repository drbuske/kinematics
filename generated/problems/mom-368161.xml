<statement>
<p>
Outside temperature over a day can be modeled as a sinusoidal function.  Suppose you know the temperature is 65 degrees at 6 a.m. and the high and low temperature during the day are 71 and 59 degrees, respectively.  Assuming midnight is when the temperature is lowest, find an equation for the temperature, <m>\displaystyle{T}{\left({t}\right)}</m>, where <m>\displaystyle{t}</m> is the number of hours since midnight.</p>
<p>
<m>\displaystyle{T}{\left({t}\right)}</m> = <fillin characters="30" /> Â
