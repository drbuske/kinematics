<statement>
<p>Imagine that you hold the handle (i.e. <m></m>stick") of the paddlewheel in the figure steady and let the blades be pushed by the fluid represented by the vector field. </p>
<p>Loading Geogebra... </p>
<p>If the stick is in the direction <m>\displaystyle{<}{0},{1},{0}{>}</m>Â would the paddlewheel spin? Rotate your view of the vector field and paddlewheel so that you get a clear view that helps you decide. Remember that your eye is at the top of the stick. </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>It would spin counter-clockwise.</li> 
<li>It would spin clockwise.</li> 
<li>It would not spin.</li> 
</ol></p>
 <p>Now change the direction of the stick to <m>\displaystyle{<}{1},{0},{0}{>}</m>. What happens? </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>The paddle would spin counter-clockwise.</li> 
<li>The paddle would spin clockwise.</li> 
<li>The paddle would not spin.</li> 
</ol></p>
