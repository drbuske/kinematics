<statement>
<p>You wish to test the following claim (<m>\displaystyle{H}_{{a}}</m>) at a significance level of <m>\displaystyle\alpha={0.05}</m>.</p>
<p>       <m>\displaystyle{H}_{{o}}:\mu_{{1}}=\mu_{{2}}</m> </p>
<p>       <m>\displaystyle{H}_{{a}}:\mu_{{1}}{>}\mu_{{2}}</m></p>
<p> You obtain a sample of size <m>\displaystyle{n}_{{1}}={42}</m> with a mean of <m>\displaystyle{M}_{{1}}={90.2}</m> and a standard deviation of <m>\displaystyle{S}{D}_{{1}}={20.1}</m> from the first population. You obtain a sample of size <m>\displaystyle{n}_{{2}}={108}</m> with a mean of <m>\displaystyle{M}_{{2}}={86.8}</m> and a standard deviation of <m>\displaystyle{S}{D}_{{2}}={13.6}</m> from the second population.</p>
<p> What is the critical value for this test? For this calculation, use the conservative under-estimate for the degrees of freedom. This is the minimum of <m>{n}_{1}</m> minus 1 or <m>{n}_{2}</m> minus 1.  (Report answer accurate to three decimal places.)</p>
<p>critical value = <fillin characters="5" /></p>
<p> What is the test statistic for this sample? (Report answer accurate to three decimal places.) </p>
<p> test statistic = <fillin characters="5" /></p>
<p> The test statistic is... </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>in the critical region</li> 
<li>not in the critical region</li> 
</ol></p>
<p> This test statistic leads to a decision to... </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>reject the null</li> 
<li>accept the null</li> 
<li>fail to reject the null</li> 
</ol></p>
<p> As such, the final conclusion is that... </p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>There is sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that the first population mean is greater than the second population mean.</li> 
<li>There is not sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that the first population mean is greater than the second population mean.</li> 
<li>The sample data support the claim that the first population mean is greater than the second population mean.</li> 
<li>There is not sufficient sample evidence to support the claim that the first population mean is greater than the second population mean.</li> 
</ol></p>
