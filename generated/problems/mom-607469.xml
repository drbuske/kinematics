<statement>
<p>
The pressure <m>\displaystyle{P}</m> (in kilopascals), volume <m>\displaystyle{V}</m> (in liters), and temperature <m>\displaystyle{T}</m> (in kelvins) of a mole of an ideal gas are related by the equation <m>\displaystyle{P}{V}={8.31}{T}</m>.  Find the rate at which the volume is changing when the temperature is <m>\displaystyle{315}</m> K and increasing at a rate of <m>\displaystyle{0.05}</m> K/s and the pressure is <m>\displaystyle{24}</m> and increasing at a rate of <m>\displaystyle{0.01}</m> kPa/s.</p>
