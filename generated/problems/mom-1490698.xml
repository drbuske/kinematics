<p>Below is a topographic map showing part of Buck River and its surrounding area. </p><image width="100%"  pi:generated="problems/images/buckriver.png" /> 
<p>A hiker walks (in a straight line) from point A to point B. Describe what happens to their elevation along the way?</p>
<p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>At point A, the hiker starts at 1500 ft.  They walk downhill for about 3 miles, reaching about 1175 ft.  Then they walk uphill for 3 miles until they return to 1500 ft. at point B.</li> 
<li>The hiker starts at an elevation of 1500 ft and remains at that elevation for the entire hike.</li> 
<li>At point A, the hiker starts at 1500 ft. They walk uphill for about 4 miles, reaching about 1825 ft. Then they walk downhill for 2 miles until they return to 1500 ft at point B.</li> 
</ol></p>
<p>What is the average rate of change in elevation when you walk from point C to point D? </p>

<p>Does the Buck River flow north-to-south or south-to-north? </p>

<solution>
<p><ul><li>C: At point A, the hiker starts at 1500 ft. They walk uphill for about 4 miles, reaching about 1825 ft. Then they walk downhill for 2 miles until they return to 1500 ft at point B.</li><li>166.66666666667</li><li>A: north-to-south</li></ul></p><p><ul>
  <li>At point A, the hiker starts at 1500 ft. They walk uphill for about 4 miles, reaching about 1825 ft. Then they walk downhill for 2 miles until they return to 1500 ft at point B.</li>
  <li>The average rate of change is (2000 ft - 1500 ft)/ (3 mi) = 500/3 ft/mi = 166.67 ft/mi.</li>
  <li>The Buck River flows north-to-south because water flows downhill. As we travel north-to-south, the Buck River encounters contours at height 1400 ft, 1300 ft, 1200 ft, 1100 ft. So this must be the direction of flow.</li>
</ul></p>
