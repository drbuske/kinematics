The total area of the air parcel remains the same after the shearing occurs. Shearing deformation is positive when the air parcel stretches in the southwest/northeast direction and contracts in the southeast/northwest direction (<a href="sec_taylor_polynomials_2var.html#ShearDeformation" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/ShearDeformation.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 7.2.4">Figure 7.2.4</a>).
