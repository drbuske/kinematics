<div class="para">The Trapezoid Rule is an average of the Left and Right Riemann sums: <span class="process-math">\(T_n = \frac{L_n + R_n}{2}\)</span> If a function is always increasing or always decreasing on the interval <span class="process-math">\([a,b]\text{,}\)</span> one of <span class="process-math">\(L_n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R_n\)</span> will over-estimate the true value of <span class="process-math">\(\int_a^b f(x) \ dx\text{,}\)</span> while the other will under-estimate the integral. Thus, the errors that result from <span class="process-math">\(L_n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R_n\)</span> will have opposite signs; so averaging <span class="process-math">\(L_n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R_n\)</span> eliminates a considerable amount of the error present in the respective approximations. In a similar way, it makes sense to think about averaging <span class="process-math">\(M_n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(T_n\)</span> in order to generate a still more accurate approximation.  Since <span class="process-math">\(M_n\)</span> is typically about twice as accurate as <span class="process-math">\(T_n\text{,}\)</span> we call the weighted average</div>

<dfn class="terminology">Simpson’s Rule</dfn>.  Note that we use ``<span class="process-math">\(S_{2n}\)</span>" rather than ``<span class="process-math">\(S_n\)</span>" since the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> points the Midpoint Rule uses are different from the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> points the Trapezoid Rule uses, and thus Simpson’s Rule is using <span class="process-math">\(2n\)</span> points at which to evaluate the function.</div>
