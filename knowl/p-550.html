<div class="para">Vorticity, therefore, has units of inverse time, for instance, <span class="process-math">\(({\rm{sec}})^{-1}\text{.}\)</span>  Fluids (and all objects) have vorticity simply because of Earth's rotation. This is called <dfn class="terminology">planetary vorticity</dfn>. We do not normally appreciate this component of vorticity since it is only important if a motion lasts for a significant portion of a day, and most important if it lasts for many days, months, or years. Since geostrophic motion is essentially steady compared with the rotation time of Earth, planetary vorticity is very important for nearly geostrophic flows. The vector of planetary vorticity <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> points upward, parallel to the rotation axis of Earth. Its magnitude is twice the angular rotation rate <span class="process-math">\(\Omega\)</span> of Earth.</div>
