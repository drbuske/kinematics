<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>Suppose we are located on the surface <span class="process-math">\(z=9-x^2-y^2\)</span> at the point <span class="process-math">\((1,2,4)\text{.}\)</span>  As your <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> coordinate changes, the value of <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> will also change.  That is, the output of the function <span class="process-math">\(f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2\text{,}\)</span> representing your height on the surface,  changes as your input, an ordered pair <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> changes.  If the input is <span class="process-math">\((1,2)\text{,}\)</span> the output is <span class="process-math">\(z=4\text{.}\)</span>  So how fast does the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-value, or height on the surface, change if we increase the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-value while holding the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> value constant (at 1)?  That is, as we ``walk'' along the surface in the positive <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-direction?</p>
