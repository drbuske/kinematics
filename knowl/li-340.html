</h5>The value of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is larger at Minneapolis than at Washington, DC.  The value of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is more than 1016 millibars at Minneapolis and is far lower than that at Wasington, DC.  The value of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\)</span> at Washington, DC is much larger than the value of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\)</span> at Minneapolis.  The rate at which the pressures are changing as one moves slightly east (in the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> direction) is much greater at Washington, DC since the isobars are closer together.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_partial_differentiation.html#li-340" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
