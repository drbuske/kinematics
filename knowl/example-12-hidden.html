<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>The speed and direction of the wind is governed by three forces; the <dfn class="terminology"></dfn> (PGF), the Coriolis Force and friction. PGF is the force produced by differences in barometric pressure between two locations and is responsible for the flow of air from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure.  PGF can be represented by a vector since it has both magnitude and direction.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The <dfn class="terminology">direction</dfn> of PGF is from the center of high pressure to the center of low pressure (see Figure~\ref{pgfexercisePic}.</p></li>
<li><p>The <dfn class="terminology">magnitude</dfn> of PGF, <span class="process-math">\(F_{PG}\)</span> can be calculated by <span class="process-math">\(\frac{F_{PG}}{mass} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \cdot \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta {\rm{distance}}}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> represents mass in kg, <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> represents air density (in kg/m<span class="process-math">\(^3\)</span>), and <span class="process-math">\(\Delta p\)</span> represents the change in pressure (in mb).</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">The units for the magnitude can be understood by conversion to mks-units: If pressure is typically reported in millibars (mb), we can convert that to Pascals (Pa) since 1 mb = 100 Pa.  We can then convert Pascals to Newtons per square meter.  We see that 1 Pa = 1 kg/(<span class="process-math">\(m \cdot s^2\)</span>).  Air density <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> can be measured in units of kg/m<span class="process-math">\(^3\text{.}\)</span>  So, the units for the magnitude of <span class="process-math">\(F_{PG}/mass\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\(-\frac{1}{kg/m^3} \cdot \frac{kg/(m\cdot s^2)}{m} = \frac{m}{s^2}\)</span> leaving units of <span class="process-math">\(F_{PG}\)</span> to be <span class="process-math">\(\frac{kg \cdot m}{s^2}\text{,}\)</span> or Newtons as expected for a force.</p></article></body>
