<div class="para">For the vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vec{F}\)</span> illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/NegativeDivergenceSphere.html" title="Figure 4.5.4">FigureÂ 4.5.4</a>, the divergence at the origin is negative since there is a net flow into that point.  All of the flow appears to be towards the origin as it passes through the surface of the sphere.  If the surface of this sphere <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> were oriented outward, then the flux of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{F}\)</span> across <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> would be negative.  Hence the flux density (i.e. the divergence) at the origin is also negative.</div>
