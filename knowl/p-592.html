<div class="para">One observes the greatest rate of fluid flow (flux) of water, measured in volume of water per unit time, through the vertical rectangular screen in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/VerticalScreen.html" title="Figure 4.4.26">FigureÂ 4.4.26</a>.  To understand this, imagine the screen were instead a window that you were holding either vertically or at an angle.  The flow would feel much stronger if the window was held vertically.  This is because so much more of the area of the window or screen is perpendicular to the flow.</div>
