<em class="emphasis">Component representation.</em> <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}_H\)</span> can be represented in terms of perpendicular velocity components.  For this representation, vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vec{i}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec{j}\)</span> represent unit vectors in directions East and North respectively.  We then write <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}_H = u\vec{i} + v\vec{j}\text{.}\)</span>  Here <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> is the <dfn class="terminology">zonal velocity</dfn>, the magnitude of the horizontal wind towards East.

<em class="emphasis">Wind speed and direction representation.</em> The wind speed is simply the magnitude of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}_H\)</span> being specified.  That is, <span class="process-math">\(\|\vec{v}_H\|\)</span> is prescribed.  Two opposite conventions are commonly used to describe wind direction.</div>

<span class="process-math">\(\phi_{vect}\)</span> is the <dfn class="terminology">wind vector azimuth</dfn>, i.e. the direction towards which the wind is blowing.  <span class="process-math">\(\phi_{vect}\)</span> increases clockwise from North when viewed from above. Terms such as northward, eastward, etc. imply wind vector azimuths.</div></li>

<span class="process-math">\(\phi_{met}\)</span> is the <dfn class="terminology">meteorological wind direction</dfn>, i.e. the direction from which the wind is blowing. <span class="process-math">\(\phi_{met}\)</span> also increases clockwise from North when viewed from above. Terms such as northerly, easterly, etc. imply meteorological wind directions.</div></li>
