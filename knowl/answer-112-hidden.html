<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\)</span> is negative at Charleston, WV.  Moving to the east from Charleston, the pressure decreases.  Units of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\)</span> are millibars per degree (of longitude).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}\)</span> is roughly zero at Santa Barbara.  This is because northward movement (in the direction of <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>) yields a similar pressure since the isobar is roughly vertical at this point.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The value of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is larger at Minneapolis than at Washington, DC.  The value of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is more than 1016 millibars at Minneapolis and is far lower than that at Wasington, DC.  The value of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\)</span> at Washington, DC is much larger than the value of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\)</span> at Minneapolis.  The rate at which the pressures are changing as one moves slightly east (in the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> direction) is much greater at Washington, DC since the isobars are closer together.</div></li>
