<div class="para">Many relationships you have studied in the past involved two variables - an independent variable (such as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>) and a dependent variable (often <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>).  In fact, most of your study of calculus involved the study of relationships <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)\text{.}\)</span>  For example, the percentage of damage <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> to a crop after a storm can be thought of as a function of maximum wind speed <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> (in mph) during that storm.  That is, <span class="process-math">\(P=f(w)\text{.}\)</span>  However, often additional variables have an impact on an outcome.  The damage to a crop after a storm is also impacted by the age <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> of the crop (in days), for example.  To represent this situation, where the percent damage <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> depends on wind speed <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> and age of crop <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> we write <span class="process-math">\(P=f(w,a)\text{.}\)</span>  In this section, we study functions of more than one variable.</div>
