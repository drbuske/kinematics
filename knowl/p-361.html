<div class="para">Earthâ€™s rotation makes atmospheric circulation more complex than otherwise would be the case. The paths of the winds on a rotating Earth are deflected by the Coriolis force. The Coriolis effect is a result of the fact that different latitudes on Earth rotate at different speeds. In 24 hours a point on the equator must complete a rotation distance equal to the circumference of the Earth, while a point right on the poles covers no distance in that time; it just turns in a circle. So the speed of rotation at the equator is about 1600 km/hr, while at the poles the speed is 0 km/hr. Latitudes in between rotate at intermediate speeds; approximately 1400 km/hr at 30<span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\)</span> and 800 km/hr at 60<span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\text{.}\)</span> As objects move over the surface of the Earth they encounter regions of varying speed, which causes their path to be deflected.</div>
