<div class="para">is what allows us to do this.  Here <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> is the density of air, <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is the gravitational constant, <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> represents pressure, and <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> represents height.  For an ideal gas, density <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> is proportional to pressure <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> and inversely proportional to temperature <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span>  That is, <span class="process-math">\(\rho = c \frac{p}{T}\)</span> for some constant <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span>  That is,</div>

\begin{equation*}

<div class="para">This equation tells us that pressure falls off exponentially with height (the only functions <span class="process-math">\(p(z)\)</span> whose derivatives are constant multiples of themselves are exponential functions).  That is, there is a one-to-one correspondence between a heights <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> and pressures <span class="process-math">\(p\text{.}\)</span>  This is why we can uniquely describe the location <span class="process-math">\((x,y,p)\)</span> of any air parcel using its pressure <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> rather than its height <span class="process-math">\(z\text{.}\)</span>  There are advantages and disadvantages to using pressure <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> as the vertical coordinate.</div>
