<div class="para">In the atmosphere, the temperature <span class="process-math">\(T(x,y,z)\)</span> varies far more vertically than it does horizontally.  The vertical change, known as the <dfn class="terminology">lapse rate</dfn>, is highly variable but is often between <span class="process-math">\(4^{\circ}C\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(10^{\circ}C\)</span> for every kilometer that <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> increases.  On the other hand, moving north or east by one kilometer is quite unlikely to cause such a dramatic change in temperature.  The fact that the variability of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial T}{\partial z}\)</span> is much larger than the variability of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\text{,}\)</span> suggests that the Laplacian <span class="process-math">\(\Delta T = \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial z^2} \approx \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial z^2}\text{.}\)</span>
