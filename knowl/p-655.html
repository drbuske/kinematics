<div class="para">What does this value tell us?  It gives a rate of change of a rate of change.  <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial C}{\partial v}\)</span> tells us the rate at which the wind chill is changing as a small change in made in the wind speed.  As we saw, these values were all negative as expected (as wind speed increases, the wind chill decreases...that is, it feels colder).  In addition, we saw that as the wind speeds increase, the rate at which we feel colder is becoming less negative (i.e. it is increasing).  This is why the second derivative <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial v^2}(20,-10)\)</span> is positive.  The second derivative gives the rate at which this rate of change is changing.  For every increase in wind speed by 1 mph, the rate at which the rate of the wind chill changes is roughly 0.03 degrees per mph.  And this matches the values of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial C}{\partial v}\)</span> that we have calculated - as the wind speed goes from 15 mph to 25 mph (10 mph of change), the change in <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial C}{\partial v}\)</span> is 0.7-0.4 = 0.3 degrees per mph.</div>
