<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Coriolis Force.</span></h3> <div class="para">Earth’s rotation makes atmospheric circulation more complex than otherwise would be the case. The paths of the winds on a rotating Earth are deflected by the Coriolis force. The Coriolis effect is a result of the fact that different latitudes on Earth rotate at different speeds. In 24 hours a point on the equator must complete a rotation distance equal to the circumference of the Earth, while a point right on the poles covers no distance in that time; it just turns in a circle. So the speed of rotation at the equator is about 1600 km/hr, while at the poles the speed is 0 km/hr. Latitudes in between rotate at intermediate speeds; approximately 1400 km/hr at 30<span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\)</span> and 800 km/hr at 60<span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\text{.}\)</span> As objects move over the surface of the Earth they encounter regions of varying speed, which causes their path to be deflected.</div> <div class="para">Imagine now a cannon positioned at the equator and facing north. Even though the cannon appears stationary to someone on Earth, it is in fact moving east at about 1600 km/hr due to Earth’s rotation. When the cannon fires, the projectile travels north towards its target; but it also continues to move to the east at 1600 km/hr, the speed it had while it was still in the cannon. As the shell moves over higher latitudes, its momentum carries it eastward faster than the speed at which the ground beneath it is rotating. For example, by 30<span class="process-math">\(^\circ\)</span> latitude the shell is moving east at 1600 km/hr while the ground is moving east at only 1400 km/hr. Therefore, the shell gets “ahead” of its target, and will land to the east of its intended destination. From the point of view of the cannon, the path of the projectile appears to have been deflected to the right (red arrow, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/CoriolisBWEarth.html" title="Figure 2.3.24">Figure 2.3.24</a>). Similarly, a cannon located at 60<span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\)</span> and facing the equator will be moving east at 800 km/hr. When its shell is fired towards the equator, the shell will be moving east at 800 km/hr, but as it approaches the equator it will be moving over land that is traveling east faster than the projectile. So the projectile gets “behind” its target, and will land to the west of its destination. But from the point of view of the cannon facing the equator, the path of the shell still appears to have been deflected to the right (green arrow, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/CoriolisBWEarth.html" title="Figure 2.3.24">Figure 2.3.24</a>). Therefore, in the Northern Hemisphere, the apparent Coriolis deflection will always be to the right.  In the Southern Hemisphere, deflection is to the left.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/CoriolisBWEarth.jpg" class="contained" alt="The Coriolis Effect."></div>
