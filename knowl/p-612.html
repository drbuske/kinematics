<div class="para">For the vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vec{F}\)</span> illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PositiveDivergenceSphere.html" title="Figure 4.5.5">FigureÂ 4.5.5</a>, the divergence at the origin is positive since there is a net flow out of that point.  While a small amount of the flow appears to be moving towards the origin from the left, much more flow is moving away towards the right.  If the surface of this sphere <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> were oriented outward, then the flux of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{F}\)</span> across <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> (no matter the size of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{!}\)</span>) would be positive.  The divergence, or flux density, at the origin is then also positive.</div>
