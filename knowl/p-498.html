<div class="para">When thinking about the chain rule, it is sometimes helpful to think of the food chain.  In this case, think of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> as representing the population of large fish that feeds on two types of medium fish having populations <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> respectively.  The populations of these medium fish depends on the population of small fish <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> In this way, it is easy to see how variation in the population of small fish impacts the populations <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> of medium fish which, in turn, impacts the population <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> of large fish.  The chain rule is the means by which we measure the rate at which the population <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> of large fish changes with respect to a change in the population <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> of small fish. Note how the resulting rate of change in this case, <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dP}{dt}\text{,}\)</span> is an ordinary derivative and not a partial derivative.  Indeed the population of large fish ultimately only depends on a single variable <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> the population of small fish.</div>
