<div class="para">Imagine now a cannon positioned at the equator and facing north. Even though the cannon appears stationary to someone on Earth, it is in fact moving east at about 1600 km/hr due to Earth’s rotation. When the cannon fires, the projectile travels north towards its target; but it also continues to move to the east at 1600 km/hr, the speed it had while it was still in the cannon. As the shell moves over higher latitudes, its momentum carries it eastward faster than the speed at which the ground beneath it is rotating. For example, by 30<span class="process-math">\(^\circ\)</span> latitude the shell is moving east at 1600 km/hr while the ground is moving east at only 1400 km/hr. Therefore, the shell gets “ahead” of its target, and will land to the east of its intended destination. From the point of view of the cannon, the path of the projectile appears to have been deflected to the right (red arrow, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/CoriolisBWEarth.html" title="Figure 2.3.24">Figure 2.3.24</a>). Similarly, a cannon located at 60<span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\)</span> and facing the equator will be moving east at 800 km/hr. When its shell is fired towards the equator, the shell will be moving east at 800 km/hr, but as it approaches the equator it will be moving over land that is traveling east faster than the projectile. So the projectile gets “behind” its target, and will land to the west of its destination. But from the point of view of the cannon facing the equator, the path of the shell still appears to have been deflected to the right (green arrow, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/CoriolisBWEarth.html" title="Figure 2.3.24">Figure 2.3.24</a>). Therefore, in the Northern Hemisphere, the apparent Coriolis deflection will always be to the right.  In the Southern Hemisphere, deflection is to the left.</div>
