<div class="para">The Laplacian of a function <span class="process-math">\(u(x,y)\)</span> tells us about the curvature of the graph.  To better understand how, let's look at the one-dimensional case.  For a function <span class="process-math">\(u(x)\)</span> of one variable, <span class="process-math">\(\Delta u = \frac{d^2 u}{dx^2}\text{.}\)</span>  In calculus we learned that the second derivative <span class="process-math">\(u''(x)\)</span> of a function indicates concavity.  When <span class="process-math">\(u'' \gt 0\text{,}\)</span> the function is concave up; when <span class="process-math">\(u'' \gt 0\text{,}\)</span> the function is concave down.  Another way to view this is to compare the value of <span class="process-math">\(u(x_0)\)</span> to nearby values.  As <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/OneDSecondDerivativevsavg.html" title="Figure 4.6.13">FigureÂ 4.6.13</a> illustrates, when <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> is concave up near <span class="process-math">\(x_0\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(u''(x_0) \gt 0\text{.}\)</span>  But we also notice that when <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> is concave up we have <span class="process-math">\(u(x_0)\)</span> is less than the average of nearby values of <span class="process-math">\(u\text{.}\)</span>
