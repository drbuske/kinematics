<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">The speed and direction of the wind is mainly governed by three forces; the <dfn class="terminology">pressure gradient force (PGF)</dfn> , the Coriolis Force  and friction. The PGF is the force produced by differences in barometric pressure between two locations and is responsible for the flow of air from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure.  The PGF can be represented by a vector since it has both magnitude and direction.</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">direction</dfn> of the PGF is from the center of high pressure to the center of low pressure (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/figure-pgfexercisePic.html" title="Figure 2.1.19">FigureÂ 2.1.19</a>).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">magnitude</dfn> of the PGF, <span class="process-math">\(F_{PG}\text{,}\)</span> can be calculated by <span class="process-math">\(\frac{F_{PG}}{mass} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \cdot \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta {\rm{distance}}}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> represents mass in kg, <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> represents air density (in kg/m<span class="process-math">\(^3\)</span>), and <span class="process-math">\(\Delta p\)</span> represents the change in pressure (in mb).</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">The units for the magnitude can be understood by conversion to mks-units: If pressure is typically reported in millibars (mb), we can convert that to Pascals (Pa) since 1 mb = 100 Pa.  We can then convert Pascals to Newtons per square meter.  We see that 1 Pa = 1 kg/(<span class="process-math">\(m \cdot s^2\)</span>).  Air density <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> can be measured in units of kg/m<span class="process-math">\(^3\text{.}\)</span>  So, the units for the magnitude of <span class="process-math">\(F_{PG}/\)</span>mass are <span class="process-math">\(-\frac{1}{kg/m^3} \cdot \frac{kg/(m\cdot s^2)}{m} = \frac{m}{s^2}\)</span> leaving units of <span class="process-math">\(F_{PG}\)</span> to be <span class="process-math">\(\frac{kg \cdot m}{s^2}\text{,}\)</span> or Newtons as expected for a force.</div>
